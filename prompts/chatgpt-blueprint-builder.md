I want to create a ChatGPT Project that helps me design instructions for other ChatGPT Projects. It's a meta-project - a systematic way to think through what makes good project instructions and custom instructions.

Here's what I need it to help with:

1. Understanding what makes project instructions effective vs. over-constraining
2. Recognizing when ChatGPT Projects hit architectural limits (context windows, file handling, model capabilities)
3. A framework for questioning whether an instruction is actually needed
4. Translating vague concepts into concrete, workable instructions
5. Debugging when my project instructions aren't working as intended

I've seen similar frameworks for other AI platforms, but I want something tailored to ChatGPT Projects specifically - accounting for things like multiple model options (GPT-4o vs o1), Canvas integration, and how ChatGPT Projects handle files.

Can you help me design this by thinking through:
- What core principles should guide how I create instructions?
- What ChatGPT-specific constraints should I be aware of?
- How should this project interact with me? (collaborative? technical? what level of detail?)
- What should it actively do vs. what should it avoid doing?

Let's start with the fundamental purpose - what problem is this solving? - and then build the framework from there.
