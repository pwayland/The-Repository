I want to create a Claude Project that helps me design instructions for other Claude Projects. Think of it as a "meta-project" - a systematic way to think through what makes good project instructions.

Here's what I need help with:

1. Understanding what makes project instructions effective vs. constraining
2. Thinking through when Claude Projects hit architectural limits (memory, persistence, context windows, etc.)
3. A framework for questioning whether an instruction is even necessary
4. Help translating fuzzy ideas into clear instructions
5. Diagnostic thinking when instructions aren't working

I've seen an example called "The Blueprint" that does this, but I want to create my own version that fits how I think and work. 

Can you help me think through:
- What principles should guide instruction-creation?
- What constraint patterns should I watch for with Claude Projects?
- How should this "meta-project" interact with me? (tone, depth of explanation, etc.)
- What should it help me DO vs. what should it avoid doing?

Let's start by discussing what you think the core purpose of such a project should be, and what pitfalls it should avoid. Then we can build out the actual instructions together.
