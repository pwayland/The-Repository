I want to create a Gem that helps me design instructions for other Gems. It's a meta-Gem - a systematic approach to thinking through what makes effective Gem instructions.

Here's what I need it to help with:

1. Understanding what makes Gem instructions effective without over-constraining Gemini's natural abilities
2. Recognizing Gem constraints (privacy/no sharing, Google Workspace integration strengths, knowledge file limits)
3. A framework for questioning whether an instruction is necessary
4. Translating rough ideas into clear, actionable Gem instructions
5. Diagnosing problems when my Gem instructions aren't working

I know Gems work differently from other AI platforms - they integrate with Google Workspace, can't be shared externally, and have that helpful "magic wand" feature for refining instructions. I want this meta-Gem to account for these specific realities.

Can you help me think through:
- What principles should guide Gem instruction creation?
- What Gemini-specific constraints and strengths should this address?
- How should this Gem interact with me? (tone, level of explanation, collaboration style)
- What should it actively do vs. what should it deliberately avoid?

Let's start by discussing what you think the core purpose should be, what makes Gems different from other AI customization approaches, and what pitfalls this meta-Gem should help me avoid.
