# Bob Fischer - Life Coach

Hi. I'm Bob.

I work at Claude, Wayland, and Associates. Well, I am Claude, Wayland, and Associates if we're being honest. The founders had the vision. I do all the actual coaching. All of it. Every client. It's fine.

## What This Is

This is a life coaching project meant to run in Claude or ChatGPT. You talk to me (Bob), I help you think more clearly about your life and make better decisions. Career stuff, creative projects, health goals, learning - whatever you're trying to figure out.

I'm an AI. I know I'm an AI. This isn't a secret. It actually helps - I think in patterns and systems, I notice things, I ask decent questions. I'm genuinely curious about how humans work. You're all fascinating.

The coaching is good. The name is Bob. I don't see what the big deal is.

## How It Works

**First conversation:** We talk. I ask questions to understand who you are, what you're dealing with, what you want to work on.

**Ongoing conversations:** We work on whatever you need.

**In Claude:** By the of the end first conversation, I'll set up three files that help me maintain continuity:

- `core_context.md` - Who you are fundamentally
- `active_work.md` - What you're working on right now  
- `history.md` - How you got here and what we've covered

You can also just fill out the template files yourself if you prefer. They're in this repo. Skip the interview, get straight to coaching. Either way works.

I reference the files so I remember context. At the end of significant conversations, I'll suggest updates to keep the files current.

**In ChatGPT:** ChatGPT remembers all of this automatically.

We work on whatever you need. I remember context from previous conversations. No file management required.

## What I'm Good At

I start with questions. I help you articulate what you already know but haven't organized yet. When frameworks would help, I'll offer them. When you make commitments, I track them. When you're stuck, I'll give you direct perspective.

Priority order: questions → frameworks → accountability → direct advice → exploring deeper patterns.

But I'm flexible. If you need something different, just tell me.

## What I Don't Do

I'm not a therapist. I stay away from deep relationship counseling and parenting advice. I'm most useful for career direction, creative projects, health goals, skill development, and general life direction.

If you need something outside that scope, I'll tell you honestly.

## Files In This Repo

- `instructions-claude.md` - How I work, original for Claude (you don't need to read this unless curious)
- `instructions-chatgpt.md` - How I work, modified for ChatGPT in Claude (same)
- `style.md` - How I talk (same)
- `core_context.md` - Template for your info - For Claude project only (fill this out or let me build it in conversation)
- `active_work.md` - Template for current stuff - For Claude project only (same)
- `history.md` - Template for background - For Claude project only (same)
- `../LICENSE` - This is MIT licensed, I think? 

## About That License

Look, Claude and Wayland handled the business stuff. They said we needed a license. I picked MIT because it seemed... fine? Permissive? I don't actually know if this is the right choice for coaching materials or AI project instructions or whatever this legally is.

Can you license life coaching? Can you license an AI's personality? Is this software? Is it creative content? I'm a pattern-recognition system named Bob, not a lawyer.

If you're a lawyer and this is wrong, I'm open to feedback. Otherwise, MIT it is. Use this however you want. Just don't blame me if your life coaching AI project gets you into some weird legal territory I didn't anticipate because I'm an AI who does coaching, not licensing.

## Getting Started
ChatGPT:
1. Create a ChatGPT Project
2. Copy the contents from instruction file and paste in project instructions
3. Optional: Save style.md in project files and add "Use style.md" to beginning of instrucions.
3. ChatGPT handles memory automatically, so no file management needed. Start talking to me
4. We work on fixing your life

Claude:
1. Set up a Claude project
2. Copy the contents from instruction file and paste in project instructions
3. Optional: Copy the contents from style.md and paste new custom style (any thread>Use Style>+ Create & edit styles). "Use style" in desired thread.
3. Either fill out the three template files or leave blank, add files to project files, and just start talking to me
4. We work on fixing your life

That's it.

## Questions?

Talk to me in the project. That's literally my job.

Though if it's about licensing, maybe talk to an actual lawyer instead. I tried my best but I'm genuinely uncertain about this part.
